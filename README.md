# NiravFirstRep
Hi, I'm Nirav Vijay, currently studying in the CEM branch at IITM. My hobbies are running, playing football and swimming.  
The one thing I like about Git is it's interface.  
The python program that I enjoyed the most is the time complexity program to compare time taken between binary and linear search.
